The increase was in line with economists' expectations.A 0.4% rise in the cost of shelter, which includes rents as well as hotel and motel rooms, accounted for more than half of the increase in the monthly CPI. Shelter costs gained 0.2% in September.Food prices rose 0.2% after advancing 0.4% in September. Grocery store food prices edged up 0.1% amid solid increases in the costs of bread, dairy products as well as nonalcoholic beverages and fruits and vegetables, which more than offset cheaper meats, poultry and fish. Egg prices plunged 6.4%.Gasoline prices eased further, falling 0.9%. But the cost of electricity jumped 1.2% and natural gas prices rose 0.3%.In the 12 months through October, the CPI advanced 2.6% after climbing 2.4% in September.The uptick in annual inflation also reflected last year's low reading dropping out of the calculation. Frustration over inflation helped to propel Republican Donald Trump to victory in last week's presidential election, defeating Democratic Party candidate and Vice President Kamala Harris.Economists are, however, forecasting higher inflation next year if Trump forges ahead with his economic policies, including tax cuts and higher tariffs on imported goods. He has also vowed mass deportations of undocumented immigrants, which economists say will shrink the labor supply, raising costs for businesses that are then passed on to consumers.Though the U.S. central bank is expected to lower rates again in December, economists see the scope for more cuts next year as limited. U.S. Treasury yields have surged as investors expect the president-elect's policies will proceed unhindered, with Republicans controlling the U.S. Senate and on the verge of clinching the House of Representatives.\"Many of these policies are more inflationary than deflationary, at least in the very near term,\" said Richard de Chazal, macro analyst at William Blair. \"The risk this time around is that consumers' willingness and ability to absorb another round of inflation is much more fragile, and it may not take much to start pushing up those all-important longer-term inflationary expectations.\"U.S. Treasury yields initially slipped after the in-line-with-expectations inflation data, before reversing course. The dollar hovered at a 6-1/2-month high against other major currencies. Stocks on Wall Street were mostly higher.A column chart titled \"Monthly change in US Consumer Price Index\" that tracks the metric over the last year.

REUTERS/Sarah Silbiger/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tabSOME STICKINESS REMAINSFinancial markets saw a roughly 82.3% probability of a 25 basis points rate cut at the Fed's Dec. 17-18 policy meeting, up from 58.7% before the data was published, according to CME Group's FedWatch Tool. The odds of rates being unchanged were at about 17.7% down from 41.3% earlier.The annual increase in inflation has slowed considerably from a peak of 9.1% in June 2022, but remains above the Fed's 2% target. The central bank last week cut its benchmark overnight interest rate by 25 basis points to the 4.50%-4.75% range.The Fed launched its policy easing cycle with an unusually large half-percentage-point rate cut in September, the first reduction in borrowing costs since 2020. It hiked rates by 525 basis points in 2022 and 2023 to tame inflation.A line chart titled \"Annual change in US Consumer Price Index\" that compares two key inflation metrics over the past five years.Some sticky inflation patches remain. Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI increased 0.3% in October, rising by the same margin for the third consecutive month. The so-called core CPI was lifted by the rise in shelter.Owners' equivalent rent, a measure of the amount homeowners would pay to rent or earn from renting their property, climbed 0.4% after gaining 0.3% in September. The cost of hotel and motel rooms rebounded 0.5%. Airline fares rose a strong 3.2%.Medical care costs increased 0.3% after rising 0.4% in September. The government made changes to physicians' services and outpatient hospital services source data and methodology. Effective with the October CPI report, secondary source medical claims data for the private insurance portion of the physicians' services and outpatient hospital services indexes was used.The cost of doctors' services increased 0.5% while prices for prescription medication rose 0.2%. Motor vehicle insurance dipped 0.1%. Overall services prices rose 0.4%, matching September's gain.Used cars and trucks prices accelerated 2.7%, the most since May 2023. Apparel prices dropped 1.5%, the largest decrease since May 2020, leaving the overall goods prices unchanged.In the 12 months through October, the core CPI gained 3.3%. That followed a similar advance in September. Core inflation increased at a 3.6% annualized rate in the last three months.Based on the CPI data, economists' estimates for the October core personal consumption expenditures (PCE) price index ranged from a 0.2% to 0.26% increase. The core PCE price index is one of the inflation measures tracked by the Fed for monetary policy. It gained 0.3% in September.Core PCE inflation was forecast rising 2.8% year-on-year in October after increasing 2.7% in each of the prior three months. October's producer price data due on Thursday could change these estimates.\"This lack of progress in reducing core inflation should raise concern among policymakers that further progress towards the 2% inflation target may have stalled out and policy may not be as restrictive as the majority at the Fed thought,\" said Conrad DeQuadros, senior economic advisor at Brean Capital.

Excluding the volatile food and energy components, the CPI increased 0.3% in October, meeting economists' forecasts.After the report, traders' bets reflected a more than 82% probability for a 25 basis-point interest rate cut at the Fed's December meeting, up from 58.7% on Monday, according to CME group's FedWatch tool, opens new tab.A bar chart that ranks a set of major product categories by price increases in the past year.While some Fed officials sounded more cautious on Wednesday, Minneapolis Fed President Neel Kashkari told Bloomberg TV that he was confident inflation was headed down, noting that the CPI data \"confirms\" that downward path.\"There's some relief inflation didn't come in ahead of expectations. That was a concern coming into today's CPI report,\" said Angelo Kourkafas, senior investment strategist at Edward Jones. \"The fact we got a right-in-line number helped alleviate some of those fears. Nothing we saw today from today's data argues against a December rate cut.\"Outperformance in the consumer discretionary sector index (.SPLRCD), opens new tab, up more than 1% on the day, was likely due to bets on rate cuts, according to Kourkafas.Still, Dallas Federal Reserve President Lorie Logan said the U.S. central bank should proceed cautiously on further interest rate cuts to keep from inadvertently re-igniting inflation.The Dow Jones Industrial Average (.DJI), opens new tab rose 47.21 points, or 0.11%, to 43,958.19, the S&P 500 (.SPX), opens new tab gained 1.39 points, or 0.02%, to 5,985.38 and the Nasdaq Composite (.IXIC), opens new tab lost 50.66 points, or 0.26%, to 19,230.74.A street sign for Wall Street is seen outside the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) in New York City, New York, U.S., July 19, 2021. REUTERS/Andrew Kelly/File Photo Purchase Licensing Rights, opens new tabAlso implying December rate cut bets, U.S. Treasury 2-year yields fell sharply after the inflation report.However, the benchmark 10-year yield regained ground after the data and rose as high as 4.46% as investors focused on longer-term expectations that President-elect Donald Trump's policies could exacerbate inflation.Still, investors are expecting a pro-business stance and possible tax cuts from the next administration.Wednesday's projections that the Republican Party had won a majority in the House of Representatives suggested that it could be easier for Trump to push through his policies, according to Sahak Manuelian, managing director and head of equity trading at Wedbush Securities.While Venu Krishna, head of U.S. equity strategy and global equity-linked strategies at Barclays, sees upside momentum for risk assets, he said the market is contending with rates, inflation and valuations that \"are bigger headwinds now than they were in 2016, the last time Trump became president.”In individual shares, Spirit Airlines' (SAVE.N), opens new tab shares plunged 59% on Wednesday after a report the U.S. carrier was preparing to file for bankruptcy protection, while the company said it was talking with creditors.Shares of Rivian (RIVN.O), opens new tab soared 13.7% after Volkswagen (VOWG_p.DE), opens new tab on Tuesday raised its investment in the EV maker.Declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 1.41-to-1 ratio on the NYSE where there were 371 new highs and 113 new lows.On the Nasdaq, 1,459 stocks rose and 2,839 fell as declining issues outnumbered advancers by a 1.95-to-1 ratio. The S&P 500 posted 58 new 52-week highs and 15 new lows while the Nasdaq Composite recorded 201 new highs and 165 new lows.On U.S. exchanges 16.49 billion shares changed hands compared with the 13.46 billion average for the last 20 sessions.

      "Inflation is down considerably from its mid-2022 peak of more than 9%.\n",
      "The Consumer Price Index rose modestly to 2.6% for the 12 months ending in October.\n",
      "In September and November, the Federal Reserve implemented interest rate cuts, with more cuts likely in the months to come.\n",
      "Inflation remains persistently above the Federal Reserve’s target 2%. For the 12-months ending in October, the Consumer Price Index (CPI) ticked up slightly to 2.6%, compared to 2.4% a month earlier.1\n",
      "Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Bank Asset Management Group, October 2024.\n",
      "While headline inflation has improved considerably from peak levels two years ago, the latest inflation report came days after an election where a large percentage of voters identified higher living costs as their most important issue. According to surveys, those most concerned with inflation tended to vote for the election's winner, Donald Trump.3\n",
      "“Core” inflation stable, but still elevated\n",
      "When eliminating the volatile food and energy sectors, inflation at the “core” level remains higher than the broader CPI. The core inflation calculation still includes, among other categories, costs for housing, transportation and medical care. October’s inflation report showed core inflation growing by 3.3% over the previous 12 months, a relatively stable reading compared to the previous five months.\n",
      "Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Bank Asset Management Group, October 2024.\n",
      "The biggest price changes in the past 12 months occurred in transportation services (+8.2%) and shelter (+4.9). By contrast, energy costs were nearly 5% lower than a year ago (including a 12% drop in gasoline prices) while food prices rose just 2.1% over the same period.1\n",
      "Fed signals less inflation concern\n",
      "Inflation has been the Federal Reserve’s primary monetary policy focus. Soaring inflation prompted the Fed to raise interest rates by more than 5% in a little more than a year, ending in 2023. In September 2024, the Fed cut the short-term federal funds target rate (that guides lending rates used by banks for overnight loans to one another and tends to influence consumer interest rates on such things as credit cards, mortgages and auto loans) by 0.50%. Just after November’s election, the Fed cut rates again by 0.25%. The policymaking Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meets again in December. With the release of October’s inflation report, markets reflected increasing confidence that another 0.25% rate cut will come out of December’s meeting.4\n",
      "Source: CME Group, “FedWatch,” November 13, 2024. Indicates the likelihood of a Fed rate cut as reflected in 30-Day fed funds futures prices.\n",
      "The Fed targets 2% inflation, as measured by the annual change in the personal consumption expenditure (PCE) price index, a measure of spending on goods and services.5 PCE was steady in September, with the headline PCE index at 2.2% for the previous 12 months. The narrower “core” PCE (excluding the volatile food and energy categories) held steady at 2.7%, the same as the prior two months.6 Both numbers remain above the Fed’s long-term 2% target.\n",
      "“Though core inflation prices remain higher than overall inflation, the Fed can live with that assuming, as is the case for now, that core costs remain level,” says Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director for U.S. Bank Asset Management. Notably, markets lowered expectations for 2025 Fed rate cuts, with renewed inflationary concerns tied to new policy proposals from the Trump campaign including the implementation of higher tariffs.\n",
      "“Though core inflation prices remain higher than overall inflation, the Fed can live with that assuming, as is the case for now, that core costs remain level,” says Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director for U.S. Bank Asset Management.\n",
      "Fed Chair Jerome Powell in early November stated that “the election will have no effects on our policy decisions.” Powell added, “In considering additional adjustments to the target range for the federal funds rate, the Committee will carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook and the balance of risks. We are not on a preset course.”7\n",
      "Inflation’s recent history\n",
      "Over the past thirty years, living costs as measured by CPI have grown by an average of 2.6% per calendar year, exactly the reading for the 12-months ended October 2024. It remained below 4% per year until 2021, when inflation surged. It now stands at more historically typical levels.2\n",
      "Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics, U.S. Bank Asset Management Group. 2024 data point based on Consumer Price Index for 12-month period ending October 2024.\n",
      "Bond markets de-couple from inflation\n",
      "Historically, bond yields tend to track inflation’s direction. While over the course of 2024 inflation has trended lower, yields on 10-year U.S. Treasury bonds recently moved higher. After the Fed’s initial rate cut in mid-September,10-year Treasury yields rose from 3.63% to 4.43%.8 “At the moment, improved real economic growth expectations are likely driving bond yields higher,” says Haworth. “Concerns about a growing federal budget deficit may also contribute to higher rates, under the assumption that the Treasury will have to issue more bonds to fund growing deficits.” Investors may demand higher yields to absorb an expanding Treasury bond supply.\n",
      "How inflation can impact your portfolio\n",
      "As inflation leveled off in 2023 and 2024, equity markets responded favorably. In late 2024, the S&P 500 is on track to gain 20% or more for the second year in a row. Investors may want to consider an overweight allocation to equities relative to fixed income investments, while retaining a neutral weight in real assets.\n",
      "At the same time, it’s important to remember that a consistent long-term strategy tends to work to the benefit of most investors. This likely precludes any dramatic changes to your asset allocation strategy in response to today’s capital market environment.\n",
      "Be sure to talk with your financial professional about what steps may be most appropriate for your situation.\n",
      "Frequently asked questions\n",
      "What is the inflation rate?\n",
      "The inflation rate measures the change in living costs for the average consumer over a given period of time. While there are various measures of inflation, the one most followed is the Consumer Price Index (CPI), a measure of changes in the prices paid by urban consumers for a market basket of consumer goods and services. The inflation rate for the 12 months ending September 2024 (as measured by CPI) was 2.4%, down from a peak of 9.1% in mid-2022. September’s reading represented the lowest annual inflation rate since February 2021.1\n",
      "What does inflation affect?\n",
      "Changes in living costs, reflected by inflation, represent a loss of purchasing power. This is an important consideration not only in your day-to-day living, but in your long-term financial planning. To improve your quality of life over time, you’ll want to see your income grow faster than the inflation rate. To retain your lifestyle in retirement, you want to be sure that income you receive from your own investments and other sources keeps pace with changes in living costs over the course of retirement. This is why inflation has such a significant impact on individuals.\n",
      "What is a high inflation rate?\n",
      "The Federal Reserve, which is charged with maintaining stable prices, targets a long-term inflation rate of 2%. Between 2012 and 2020, the annual inflation rate was between 0.7% and 2.3%. Since that time, inflation has been much higher. It stood at 7.0% in 2021, 6.5% in 2022 and 3.4% in 2023. Through October 2024, inflation over the previous 12 months was 2.6%.2 Still, headline inflation remains above the Federal Reserve’s 2% target.4\n",

      "Key takeaways\n",
      "At its November 2024 meeting, the Fed cut interest rates by 0.25%, following its 0.50% cut in September.\n",
      "The Fed’s actions aligned with market expectations.\n",
      "Investors anticipate additional interest rate cuts are likely in the months ahead.\n",
      "With the 0.25% cut in the federal funds target rate in November, the Federal Reserve’s (Fed’s) Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) continues to recalibrate U.S. monetary policy as inflation recedes. The latest rate cut followed September’s 0.50% cut. The fed funds target rate, the rate banks charge each other for overnight lending that also tends to influence consumer interest rates, is currently set at 4.50% to 4.75%. \n",
      "The Fed held rates at 5.25% to 5.50% from July 2023 to September 2024. Between March 2022 and July 2023, the Fed raised rates eleven times, from near 0%.\n",
      "Source: U.S. Federal Reserve, November 7, 2024.\n",
      "While FOMC members and investors anticipate continued fed fund rate cuts into 2025, Fed Chair Jerome Powell said after November’s meeting that “We are not on any preset course. We will continue to make our decisions, meeting by meeting.” He noted that the Fed would “carefully assess incoming data, the evolving outlook and the balance of risks.”1\n",
      "The U.S. economy continues to demonstrate solid growth, with third quarter Gross Domestic Product (GDP) expanding at an annualized pace of 2.8%, following 3.0% second quarter growth.2 “The consumer is still hanging in there,” says Eric Freedman, chief investment officer for U.S. Bank Asst Management. “However, the environment may be getting a little tougher for lower-income consumers.”\n",
      "Powell indicates that even with the economy on a favorable growth track, the Fed feels cutting rates is appropriate as it tries to achieve what is considered a “neutral” fed funds target rate. Powell indicated that elevated interest rates may be a drag on the economy.3 “A key question is the level which would be considered a neutral fed funds rate,” says Rob Haworth, senior investment strategy director for U.S. Bank Asset Management. “Markets are likely to watch that closely.” In its own projections, the FOMC has indicated the fed funds rate could level off near 3%.4\n",
      "Along with interest rate cuts, the Fed continues what it began in 2022, reducing its balance sheet of fixed income assets. At its peak, the Fed’s balance sheet grew to nearly $9 trillion dollars. Each month, the Fed trims its Treasury bond holdings by $25 billion, and cuts its mortgage-backed securities positions by $35 billion. Its holdings are now approximately $7 trillion.5 “It seems unlikely the Fed will drop its balance sheet back to the $4 trillion level, as it stood in 2015-16, but given the extent the economy has grown since then, a larger Fed balance sheet may be justified,” says Haworth.\n",
      "The Fed’s Balancing Act\n",
      "The Fed’s primary purpose in raising rates and keeping them elevated was to combat the highest inflation since the early 1980s. At its peak, inflation, as measured by the Consumer Price Index (CPI), reached 9.1% for the 12 months ending in June 2022. The most recent CPI reading, for the 12 months ending in September 2024, showed inflation at a much improved 2.4%.6 “Given the recent rate cuts, the Fed is saying that it recognizes inflation is coming down,” says Freedman.”\n",
      "Source: U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics. As of September 30, 2024.\n",
      "The Fed is increasingly focused on the U.S. labor market. Slowing payroll growth and a rising unemployment rate are concerns.7 “The Fed doesn’t want to see too much softness in the employment market,” says Haworth. That would contribute to a slowing economy. Although the nation’s unemployment rate moved above 4% in mid-2024, it has, in recent months, held steady.7\n",
      "“Given the recent rate cuts, the Fed is saying that it recognizes inflation is coming down,” says Eric Freedman, chief investment officer for U.S. Bank Asset Management.” \n",
      "Haworth notes initial jobless claims provide a helpful “real-time” guide on the state of the jobs market. “Initial claims continue to hold within a modest range, which shows that the labor market remains stable for now,” says Haworth.8\n",
      "Source: U.S. Employment and Training Administration. As of November 2, 2024.\n",
      "Bond market’s response\n",
      "Bond markets appeared to anticipate September’s fed funds rate cut. From April through mid-September, yields on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond trended lower. However, since then, longer-term bond yields moved higher.9\n",
      "Source: U.S. Department of the Treasury, Daily Treasury Par Yield Curve Rates.\n",
      "Increases in long-term bond yields appeared to be in response to continued strong economic data. The impact to consumers is felt, for instance, in higher mortgage rates. Powell noted that the recent uptick in long-term yields limited fed funds rate cut benefits. “The big increase in mortgage rates, from 6.2% to 7% in the past seven weeks, hits harder than a quarter-percentage point drop in a credit card rate,” says Powell.1\n",
      "10-year Treasury bond yields rose significantly on November 6, the day after former President Donald Trump was re-elected to office. It may have represented the market’s initial read on the potential impact of Trump’s economic policy proposals, including plans to raise tariffs, which could have inflationary implications. Powell, for now, downplayed possible monetary policy ramifications. “In the near term, the election will have no effect on our policy decisions.”1\n",
      "Where does the Fed go from here\n",
      "Markets anticipate one more 2024 fed funds rate cut, coming at the FOMC’s mid-December meeting. This is based on the CME FedWatch Tool, which analyzes the probabilities of fed fund rate changes based on interest rate trader actions. The tool indicates the likelihood of a 0.25% rate cut in December.10\n",
      "Source: CME Group, FedWatch, as of November 7, 2024.\n",
      "As the Fed continues to address monetary policy, be sure to consult with your financial professional and review portfolio positioning. Explore whether changes might be appropriate given your goals, time horizon and feelings toward risk in today’s evolving interest rate environment.\n",
      "Frequently asked questions\n",
      "What is monetary policy?\n",
      "Monetary policy is controlled by a nation’s central bank, which in the United States, is the Federal Reserve (Fed). The Fed’s management of monetary policy can have a significant impact on the shape of the nation’s economy. Congress’ mandate for the Fed is to maintain price stability (manage inflation); promote maximum sustainable employment (low unemployment); and provide for moderate, long-term interest rates. Fed monetary policy influences the cost of many forms of consumer debt such as mortgages, credit cards and automobile loans.\n",
      "What is the Federal Reserve (Fed)?\n",
      "The Fed is the nation’s central bank, and perhaps the most influential financial institution in the world. The central governing board of the Federal Reserve reports to Congress, with the chair of the Federal Reserve appointed by the President. There are also 12 regional federal reserve banks that are set up like private corporations.\n",
      "Why does the Federal Reserve (Fed) raise or lower interest rates?\n",
      "The Federal Reserve’s Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) sets a target interest rate policy for the federal funds rate. This is the rate at which commercial banks borrow and lend excess reserves to other banks on an overnight basis. The fed funds rate is raised or lowered usually to help impact underlying economic conditions. For example, in 2022, as inflation surged, the FOMC began raising interest rates to make borrowing more expensive and slow economic activity. That strategy was designed to ease pricing pressures and reduce the inflation rate. In periods when the economy is slow or in a recession, the Fed tends to lower rates to try to stimulate economic activity and help the economy expand again.\n",

      "Despite persistent concerns surrounding the durability of growth and interest rate policy, the US economy remains fundamentally strong. While real gross domestic product growth slowed in the first quarter of this year, growth rebounded to a strong 3.0% in the second quarter. All available evidence suggests policymakers may have managed to bring inflation under control without causing a recession.\n",
      "Deloitte’s baseline scenario remains relatively positive. The boom in factory construction will continue to boost the economy’s potential in the coming years. In the short term, a faster pace of interest rate cuts by the Fed should allow households to take on more debt and support continued growth in consumer spending. Coupled with elevated government consumption, we expect the US economy to grow by 2.7% this year.\n",
      "In addition to this relatively positive baseline scenario, we include two alternate scenarios: an upside scenario where positive structural changes to the labor market occur in the long run and labor productivity gains exceed our baseline forecast, and a downside scenario that highlights the potential of geopolitical conflict and trade policy to stoke persistent inflation.1\n",
      "Scenarios\n",
      "Baseline (60%): Real GDP growth came in stronger than expected in the second quarter of 2024, after slowing in the first quarter. The contrasting results were caused by a big drawdown in inventories in the first quarter, followed by their replenishment in the second quarter; on average, GDP grew at a reasonably strong pace of 2.2% through the first half of this year. We expect GDP to continue growing at a similar pace throughout the remainder of this year before slowing in 2025.\n",
      "Overall, the story for the US economy remains positive. Consumer spending keeps coming in stronger than expected and is forecasted to rise 2.4% in 2024, slightly more than the 2.2% increase recorded last year. Business investment is predicted to rise 4.2% in this year, down only slightly from the 4.5% growth recorded in 2023. The Inflation Reduction Act and the Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors (CHIPS) and Science Act are predicted to keep driving strong gains in structures and machinery and equipment investments, while firms continue to heavily invest in software and other intellectual property like artificial intelligence. On the trade front, growth in exports is expected to slow to 2.2% in 2024 before picking up again the following year, while imports are forecasted to increase 3.8% this year. Government spending is predicted to rise 2.9% in 2024.\n",
      "Consumer price index (CPI) inflation finally fell below 3.0% in July and is expected to continue decreasing, hitting 2.7% by the fourth quarter. Job growth is forecasted to continue slowing, and we expect demographic changes to continue driving down the labor force participation rate. The unemployment rate has risen to its highest level since October 2021. With inflation on the decline and the unemployment rate on the rise, the Federal Reserve is on track to begin cutting rates in September. We predict the target rate to fall 100 basis points this year and a further 100 basis points in 2025.\n",
      "Overall, real GDP is expected to increase 2.7% in 2024 and by 1.5% in 2025. Between 2026 and 2028, real GDP growth is forecasted to hover between 1.7% and 2.1% per year.\n",
      "Persistent inflation and geopolitical conflicts (20%): While our baseline remains positive, there are always downside risks to any forecast. We see risks centering around two interrelated issues: 1) geopolitical conflicts and 2) trade policy, which could combine to yield persistent inflation.\n",
      "Conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East are at risky stages, and the possibility of escalation is high. Both conflicts are in regions with major petroleum production, and so one likely outcome of escalation could come in the form of higher oil prices. In this scenario, the price of oil rises and remains about US$10 above baseline throughout 2025.\n",
      "Geopolitical conflicts are not just fought with weapons; trade policy is increasingly a battleground for competition. The US presidential election is in full swing, and both major party candidates appear poised to pursue some degree of tariffs on foreign imports. Though the precise effects depend on the tariff design and implementation, these policies will likely impact prices faced by American firms and consumers. Therefore, in this scenario, we model tariffs that increase the cost of imported intermediate inputs by 1% and of imported final goods by a further 1%.\n",
      "As a result of the tariffs and the oil price shock, CPI inflation persists above 3% until the third quarter of 2025. Although this scenario still has the same September rate cut as in the baseline scenario, the increased inflationary pressures in late 2024 and 2025 mean the Fed is unable to cut rates further until the end of 2025.\n",
      "In this scenario, GDP growth is lower compared to the baseline scenario, particularly over the next two years. Growth in 2024 is 2.6%; by the following year, the tariffs are fully implemented and growth in 2025 is just 1.0%. Growth then averages 2.0% per year from 2026 to 2028.\n",
      "A golden era for labor markets (20%): Over the past few years, firms have been investing heavily in software and technology. Some of these investments—like those in AI—offer the potential to transform certain types of work. Based on an optimistic view of the uptake and usefulness of new technologies, this scenario sees productivity growing by an average of 1.8% per year from 2024 through 2028, compared to 1.5% in the baseline.\n",
      "In addition to the productivity dividend, this scenario sees higher population growth, contributing to an overall population that is 1.1 million larger than in the baseline scenario by the end of the forecast. Along with a bigger population, we model a higher labor force participation rate, as workers continue to delay retirement. Together, these dynamics result in a higher supply of labor for the economy. More workers lead to more output and more spending in a virtuous circle that lifts the overall economy.\n",
      "In this scenario, GDP will rise faster than the baseline forecast over the entire forecast horizon. From 2024 through 2028, GDP will increase at an average annual rate of 2.5% per year, 0.5 percentage points higher than the baseline forecast. This scenario also results in higher long-term potential for the economy at 2.8%, compared to 2.2% in the baseline. In that sense, this scenario shows what it would take to make recent rates of economic growth sustainable in the long run.\n",

      "Consumer spending\n",
      "Real consumer spending continues to exceed expectations. In July, real personal consumption expenditure (PCE) rose 0.5% following a 0.3% increase in June. For the second quarter of 2024, overall PCE grew by 2.9% (at annual rates). Spending on durable goods increased 4.9% during the second quarter after falling 4.5% in the first quarter. Increased spending on durables is often seen as a signal of rising consumer confidence.\n",
      "Households depleted their pandemic-era excess savings in March of this year, 2 and as a result, continuing gains in consumer spending is expected to be driven by growing income and the ability of households to add new debt. Household debt increased US$109 billion in the second quarter, which helped boost consumers’ ability to spend.3\n",
      "Interest-rate cuts later this year should provide even more room for consumption to rise as households will be able to comfortably take on more debt. We forecast growth in consumer spending to rise again in the third quarter before slowing at the end of the year. Overall, for 2024, we predict real consumer spending to increase 2.4%. Spending on durable goods is expected to rise 1.6% in 2024, and spending on nondurable goods is expected to rise by 1.7%. Interest-rate cuts should drive stronger demand for durable goods next year and throughout the remainder of the forecast. Spending on services is predicted to increase more rapidly than spending on goods, rising 2.8% this year and 2.0% in 2025.\n",
      "Our headline numbers are already in real (inflation-adjusted) terms, but inflation has an impact on the composition of spending baskets. The Conference Board’s survey of consumer confidence shows that uncertainty around elevated prices, specifically food and grocery prices, remains a key concern for consumers.4 If consumers still feel the price of essentials like food items are rising too rapidly, they could potentially reduce their spending on discretionary goods or services, posing a threat to our consumer spending forecast.\n",

      "Housing\n",
      "Home sales and construction have been limited so far this summer as interest rates, and consequently mortgage rates, remain elevated. In July, both housing starts and the volume of permits were down, with particularly large declines recorded in the South.5 Furthermore, according to the National Association of Realtors, existing home sales rose 1.3% in July and the median sales was US$422,600, up 4.2% from the same time last year.6\n",
      "The slowdown in the housing market is expected to cause housing starts to fall in the short term, but as home prices continue to rise, builders may respond with higher starts. We project 1.35 million housing starts this year, down from over 1.4 million recorded in 2023, but in 2025, housing starts are expected to rise to over 1.4 million and remain around that level over the longer term. In 2025 and 2026, the housing stock is expected to rise more rapidly than total population. However, that trend is expected to reverse in the later years of the forecast period. Despite a strong level of construction in the medium term, for there to be a real impact on affordability, more of this new construction will need to be “starter homes” and will need to be built in parts of the country experiencing the largest increases in population. We expect this to remain a challenge. Consequently, the house price index is forecasted to rise 5.0% in 2024, with growth expected to slow to 2.6% in 2025 and remain between 2.2% and 2.4% from 2026 to 2028.\n",

      "Business investment\n",
      "Investment is spending that helps grow the long-term productive capacity of the economy, and as such is the most important sector for understanding an economy’s potential. While higher interest rates are used to combat inflation by reducing demand, they can paradoxically cause inflationary pressures to persist for longer by making it more expensive for firms to invest in the capacity to produce more and relieve supply pressures. The average corporate borrowing rate increased to nearly 7% by the end of 2023 and remained elevated through the first half of 2024, presenting a barrier to firms who need to borrow to invest. However, many firms have cash on hand7 and can avoid borrowing at these rates, and thus, business investment has been coming in stronger than expected since the start of the year. With the Fed predicted to start cutting rates in September, corporate borrowing costs are also expected to fall, which should help further drive growth in business investment. We predict business investment to increase 4.2% in 2024 and another 4.0% in 2025. In the longer term, growth in business investment is expected to remain elevated.\n",
      "Investment in structures, which includes both buildings and engineering structures such as power plants and oil platforms, has typically followed a cyclical pattern, and is often driven by commodity price booms and economic cycles. However, another factor that has been driving growth in this investment class, especially in manufacturing construction investment, is the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act and the CHIPS and Science Act. These pieces of legislation aimed to increase US production of strategic technologies like electric vehicles, batteries, renewable energy, and semiconductors.8 Since their passage in August of 2022, spending on manufacturing construction has skyrocketed, with investment in structures rising 13.2% in 2023. While the outlook isn’t as rosy for all subsectors (with office space prices down and vacancy rates up, the office segment of the commercial real estate market is expected to remain under stress),9 we forecast that overall investment in structures will rise 5.3% in 2024 and 2.9% in 2025.\n",
      "As factory construction increases, so does equipment investment and intellectual property investment—categories that capture everything from plant machinery and computers to software has increased since the start of 2024. We predict the rise in manufacturing construction activity to continue to increase investments in equipment and intellectual property throughout this year and next. Overall, the forecast shows spending on business equipment rising 2.6% this year and 4.6% in 2025. This type of spending has seen a strong upward trend over time, and we expect that strong trend growth to remain throughout the rest of the forecast period.\n",
      "Business investment in intellectual property, which includes not only software purchases but also research and development spending, increased significantly during the pandemic as firms worked to adapt to a new reality of remote work. Growth in intellectual property investment is expected to slow compared to the gains observed in 2021 and 2022 but will remain elevated over the course of the forecast period as many sectors incorporate AI and other technologies.\n",

      "Export volumes have been hovering around pre-pandemic levels since 2022, while import volumes rose well above pre-pandemic levels starting in 2021. These trends continued into the first half of this year; export growth has slowed while imports continue to rise, widening the trade deficit. Into this context, the US administration announced significant new tariffs on Chinese imports—notably steel, aluminum, and EVs—earlier this year.10 At the time of writing, details of the tariffs had not yet been published. Both the Democratic and Republican presidential candidates are promising further increases in tariffs. In general, the impact of tariffs on Americans will depend on the specifics of their design and implementation. Either administration will be hoping that they can protect American producers of these goods from being undercut by Chinese products without causing significant price increases for American consumers.\n",
      "It is also worth remarking briefly on some other major trade stories that have fallen out of the headlines. In late 2023 and early 2024, the Panama Canal Authority reduced the number of transits allowed due to low water levels. The drought situation there has now resolved, and as of Aug. 5, 2024, the number of transits allowed through the canal increased to 35, bringing the number of available slots close to the average number of daily trips before water levels started to fall.11 However, climate change may continue to pose similar drought-related risks to this key shipment route in the future.12\n",
      "At the same time, since the beginning of the Israel-Palestine conflict in October 2023, Houthi forces in Yemen have launched more than 110 attacks on vessels transiting the Red Sea toward the Suez Canal.13 In response, global shipping companies reduced the volume of Suez Canal crossings by 66% between November 2023 and April 2024.14 Vessels have had to be rerouted around the Cape of Hope in South Africa, significantly increasing travel time between Asia and Europe. While US exports and imports are not as reliant on the Suez Canal route, rerouting vessels has caused global transit times to rise, consequently increasing shipping rates and creating capacity shortages as extended voyages reduces the number of ships available.15\n",
      "Our baseline forecast expects growth in exports to pick back up toward the end of this year and the start of next. However, we expect imports will continue rising faster than exports as consumers continue spending. Overall, in 2024, exports are expected to increase 2.2% and imports are predicted to rise 3.8%.\n",

      "One of the most important policies in recent years has been the Inflation Reduction Act. It aims to reduce the federal deficit, increase investments in domestic manufacturing and energy production, and decrease greenhouse gas emissions by 40% by 2030.16 This 10-year plan is the single largest investment in tackling climate change in American history.17\n",
      "Despite the Inflation Reduction Act aiming to reduce the federal budget deficit, we predict the deficit as a share of GDP will fall only temporarily, hitting 5.9% in 2024 before rising in 2025 and 2026. The federal government’s future capacity to borrow at current levels will rely on two key factors: investor confidence and the availability of excess savings worldwide. Our forecast anticipates that the 10-year federal bond rate will remain high, but will fall slightly compared to the elevated rates recorded in recent quarters, fluctuating between 3.5% and 4.0% throughout the forecast period.\n",

      "Markets were concerned with the weaker-than-expected July jobs data from the Bureau of Labor Statistics.18 The unemployment rate increased 0.2 percentage points to 4.3%, the highest level recorded since October 2021.19 The rise in the unemployment rate in July was large enough to trigger the Sahm rule, an indicator used by economists as an advance warning that a recession has begun. Our view, and indeed, Claudia Sahm’s view, is that the broad spectrum of data suggests that the July data are not a cause for immediate concern, and that the US labor market remains relatively strong. We predict employment to continue rising over the coming quarters, although at a slightly slower pace than the beginning of the year. By the second quarter of next year, the unemployment rate is expected to start falling slowly, returning below 4.0% by the end of the forecast period. Wage growth will also continue to slow along with inflation.\n",
      "In the longer term, the demographic shift will play a crucial role in shaping labor supply dynamics. Similar to other developed nations, the United States has an aging population and is experiencing a decline in population growth. However, unlike certain countries, the United States has not reached a stage where the population growth rate is negative. Nevertheless, the slower rate of growth will limit the availability of workers. We believe participation rates within many age groups will continue to rise, especially among the 55-plus age cohort. However, aging will outweigh the increase in participation rates, meaning we expect the overall participation rate to slowly fall over the remainder of the forecast period. Historically, relatively low rates of job growth reflected economic weakness. However, given the new demographic realities, the economy’s sustainable pace of job growth will be limited by the relative lack of available workers.\n",

      "The Federal Open Market Committee has held firm on rates so far this year, but with inflation finally nearing the 2.0% target, the general sentiment in markets is that the Fed will begin cutting rates in September. Our forecast includes a 50-basis-point cut in September, followed by two 25-basis-point cuts in November and December, bringing the Fed’s target rate range to 4.25% to 4.5% by the end of 2024.\n",
      "One concern noted by some commentators is that the Fed might want to avoid making rate-cut decisions if they are perceived to have an impact on the US presidential election this fall. We don’t believe this is a concern; past evidence suggests that the Fed does not allow election cycles to influence its rate policy.20\n",
      "However, the Federal Open Market Committee will be closely monitoring the labor market to determine the size of the cut in September and the pace of cuts thereafter. Should July’s uptick in unemployment prove to be a trend rather than a blip, Fed policymakers may feel an even faster pace of cuts is appropriate. We expect rate cuts to continue in 2025 and 2026 as inflation continues to fall, with rates settling at a range of 2.25% to 2.5% by the first quarter of 2027.\n",

      "CPI inflation continues to decline from its peak in the second quarter of 2022. Year-on-year CPI inflation for all items fell to 2.9% in July, finally ticking below the 3.0% mark for the first time since early 2021. The Federal Reserve’s preferred measure of inflation, the PCE deflator, came in at 2.5% year over year in July, inching closer to the Federal Reserve’s target. However, the pace of PCE inflation decrease remains slow, indicating that inflation may not cross the 2.0% threshold for some time.\n",
      "Our forecast predicts that headline CPI inflation will remain below 3.0% and continue to fall over the coming quarters, in part due to falling energy prices. Core inflation will remain above 3.0% until the first quarter of 2025, as the pace of rate cuts relieves some of the downward pressure on price growth. Overall, our forecast is based on an assumption that long-term trend inflation will converge to 2.0%.\n",

      "\n",
      "The latest news and updates on inflation in the US indicate that the rate of inflation has been slowing down, but still remains above the Federal Reserve's target of 2%. The Consumer Price Index (CPI) rose 0.2% in October, bringing the annual inflation rate to 2.6%. Core inflation, which excludes food and energy prices, also rose 0.3% in October, bringing the annual core inflation rate to 3.3%.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Federal Reserve has been closely monitoring the inflation rate and has implemented interest rate cuts to help control inflation. In September, the Fed cut the interest rate by 0.50%, and in November, it cut the interest rate by 0.25%. The Fed's actions have helped to lower the unemployment rate and boost economic growth.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the positive trends, there are still concerns about the impact of inflation on the stock market. The S&P 500 has been experiencing volatility, and investors are closely watching the inflation rate and the Fed's actions to determine the direction of the market.\n",
      "\n",
      "In terms of specific news articles, Reuters reported that the Fed's rate cuts have helped to boost the stock market, with the S&P 500 gaining 1.39 points on Wednesday. However, the article also noted that the Fed's actions have also led to a surge in long-term bond yields, which has pushed up mortgage rates.\n",
      "\n",
      "US Bank reported that the Fed's interest rate cuts have helped to reduce the inflation rate, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) falling below 3.0% in July. However, the article also noted that the inflation rate is still above the Fed's target of 2%, and that the Fed's actions may not be enough to bring the inflation rate down to the target level.\n",
      "\n",
      "Deloitte reported that the US economy remains fundamentally strong, with a boom in factory construction and elevated government consumption. However, the article also noted that there are risks to the forecast, including geopolitical tensions and trade policy.\n",

      "Overall, the latest news and updates on inflation in the US indicate that the rate of inflation is slowing down, but still remains above the Federal Reserve's target.

      "outlook. In this scenario, continued geopolitical conflicts and trade actions cause inflation to stay higher for longer, driving the Federal Reserve to hike rates.1 Scenarios Baseline (70%): Real GDP growth slowed overall in the first quarter of 2024, coming in very close to our previous forecast’s expectations.2 We expect GDP growth will continue to moderate through the second half of this year and the start of the next, but the story is still positive overall. Consumer spending is forecasted to rise 2.3% this year, up from the 2.2% increase in 2023. Business investment is expected to increase 3% in 2024, down from 4.5% last year. Government spending is forecasted to rise 2.5%. Given that the US economy is expected to outperform many other global economies in the short term, we forecast imports to increase 3.1% on average in 2024, while exports are predicted to rise at a slower pace of 2.4%. Consumer price index (CPI) inflation stays above the 3% threshold for the second quarter of this year before falling to 2.7% by the end of 2024. The Federal Reserve succeeds in walking the tightrope to a soft landing by cutting rates twice in the second half of 2024 and continues with cuts until reaching the neutral rate of 2.5% to 3% by 2027. Job growth slows because current levels of job formation are not sustainable, given demographics and labor force participation. As a result, the unemployment rate falls in the short term, but rises to just under 4% in 2025 before gradually declining through the rest of the forecast period. Major investments prompted by the Inflation Reduction Act provide a boost to manufacturing.3 In addition, investments in intellectual property—such as the use of AI and other novel technologies—will continue to drive growth in the business sector. Overall, we expect the US economy to post real GDP growth of 2.4% this year, but for growth to slow to 1.1% in 2025. Between 2026 and 2028, economic growth is expected to pick back up, with annual gains in\n",

      "real GDP forecasted to range between 1.6% and 1.9% per year. Persistent inflation and geopolitical conflicts (20%): While our baseline remains positive, there are always downside risks to any forecast. We see risks centering around three interrelated issues: 1) geopolitical conflicts, 2) persistent inflation, and 3) financial system stress. Major conflicts in Ukraine and the Middle East have been simmering for some time; either or both could flare up to a higher level. We see the most likely impact of such escalation coming in the form of higher prices of imported goods and oil. In this scenario, the price of oil spikes to around US$100 for three quarters before gradually declining. Geopolitical conflicts are not just fought with guns. The past two American administrations have used tariffs and sanctions to varying degrees as tools to influence adversaries. The use of these tools can have an impact on the prices faced by American firms and consumers. In this scenario, we model tariffs that increase the cost of imported intermediate inputs by 1% and imported final goods by a further 1%. As a result of the tariffs and the oil price shock, the Federal Reserve is driven to hike rates twice in the near term. Even with this action, CPI inflation persists above 3% until the second quarter of 2025. The latest Federal Reserve Financial Stability Report4 highlights three near-term risks to the stability of the financial system: higher-for-longer interest rates; worsening geopolitical conflict and spillovers; and strains on real-estate markets, particularly for office real estate. In line with the other assumptions outlined above, we therefore model an increase in stress in the financial system. In this scenario, GDP growth is lower than in the baseline scenario, particularly over the next two years. Growth in 2024 is 2.2%; by the following year, the tariffs are fully implemented, and growth in 2025 is just 0.6%. Growth averages 1.7% per year from 2026 to 2028. A golden era\n",

      "As we enter 2024, inflation continues to be a critical concern for both policymakers and investors. The inflation rate has shown signs of moderation but remains above the Federal Reserve’s target levels, affecting consumer purchasing power and overall economic sentiment.

      "## The Current Landscape of Inflation\n",
      "\n",
      "Recent data indicates that inflation in the U.S. has begun to stabilize, with the Consumer Price Index (CPI) showing a tentative decrease in inflationary pressures. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, the CPI rose by 3% year-over-year as of December 2023, compared to a peak of over 9% in mid-2022. This decrease signals a potential easing of the inflationary spiral that has plagued the economy for over a year, but several challenges remain.\n",
      "\n",
      "Despite the positive trend, high prices in key sectors—such as groceries and housing—continue to burden consumers. The persistence of inflation is largely attributed to supply chain disruptions and geopolitical tensions, which exacerbate the demand-supply imbalance. Understanding these dynamics is essential for investors, as they can heavily influence market movements and stock valuations throughout the year.\n",
      "\n",
      "## Implications for the Stock Market\n",
      "\n",
      "The stock market is often sensitive to inflation levels, as rising prices can erode corporate profits and dampen consumer spending. Historically, when inflation remains elevated, interest rates typically follow suit, leading to higher borrowing costs for both individuals and businesses. This, in turn, can result in stock market volatility as investors reassess their valuations and growth expectations.\n",
      "\n",
      "In 2024, the anticipated continued moderation of inflation could provide a cushion for equity markets. Analysts predict that if inflation trends lower, the Federal Reserve may adopt a more dovish monetary policy, potentially pausing interest rate hikes or even considering cuts later in the year. Such a scenario could bolster investor confidence, providing a more favorable environment for stocks—especially in sectors like technology and consumer discretionary that were hit hard by rising rates.\n",
